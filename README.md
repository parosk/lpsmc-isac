 The Ideal School Automation Control (ISAC) was developed when I was working in a local secondary school known as 
 Liu Po Shan Memorial College (LPSMC), together with students we developed this prototype to automate the classroom 
 with the aid of Raspberry Pi. This project get the Championship in secondary school section in YPEC 2016 HK section.

The code uploaded are NOT COMPLETE, just the main code are uploaded, files like css/js lib are omitted, so it is not possible to "download and run " the code directly 

# DETAIL EXPLANATION 
The raspberry pi is acting as a server,with flask-socket.io running . To control ISAC, the client, usually a computer or a phone, has to be connect to the #same local area network with the RPi. We can either use a phone/computer to enter the control panel page.
In a manual mode, when a button is clicked on the client’s side, a JSON object that represent the action is sent to the RPi server via WebSocket. Upon receiving the message, the RPi will alter the output of that particular GPIO to start/shut down on electrical appliance. Furthermore, the client will repeatedly send a message to the server to ask for the latest light #and temperature data. After the client reveives the messages emitted for the server, the client will update the sensor data #by JavaScript.
In an automatic mode, the client will repeatedly send a message to the server to ask for automation, i.e. control of the # output of GPIO by the sensor’s  data. Those sensor’s data are also sent to the client for Display also.
